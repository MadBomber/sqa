# SQA - Simple Qualitative Analysis

This is a very simplistic set of tools for running technical analysis on a stock portfolio.  Simplistic means it is not reliable nor intended for any kind of financial use.  Think of it as a training tool.  I do.  Its helping me understand while I need professional help from people who know what they are doing.

The BUY/SELL signals that it generates are part of a game.  **DO NOT USE** when real money is at stake.
