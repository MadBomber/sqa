# Next Steps - SQA Project Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-01-05
**Session:** claude/review-codebase-planning-011CUqHdDz75cZMoeGXq8XfR

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Planning
- ✅ **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete architecture documentation (1000+ lines)
- ✅ **TASKS.md** - Detailed task list and project tracking
- ✅ Both files pushed to branch: `claude/review-codebase-planning-011CUqHdDz75cZMoeGXq8XfR`

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 2: Review Planning Documents

The planning documents are in the sqa repository:

**View on GitHub:**
- ARCHITECTURE.md: https://github.com/MadBomber/sqa/blob/claude/review-codebase-planning-011CUqHdDz75cZMoeGXq8XfR/ARCHITECTURE.md
- TASKS.md: https://github.com/MadBomber/sqa/blob/claude/review-codebase-planning-011CUqHdDz75cZMoeGXq8XfR/TASKS.md

**What's documented:**
- Complete 3-gem architecture
- All design decisions
- Implementation timeline
- AI integration strategy
- Migration guides
- Task breakdown

---

### Step 3: Authorize Repositories (For Future Work)

To continue with sqa-cli and refactoring, I'll need access to:
- ✅ MadBomber/sqa (already have access)
- ❌ MadBomber/sqa-talib (needs authorization)
- ❌ MadBomber/sqa-cli (needs authorization)

**How to authorize:**
- Look for Claude Code settings in your interface
- Add these repositories to the session
- OR start a new session with all three repos selected

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### After You Transfer sqa-talib:

1. **I can continue with sqa-cli**
   - Create complete CLI gem structure
   - Migrate CLI code from sqa
   - Add AI integration (ruby_llm)
   - Add SQLite persistence
   - Complete documentation

2. **Then refactor sqa to v1.0.0**
   - Remove indicator code
   - Add sqa-talib dependency
   - Update tests
   - Create migration guide
   - Bump to v1.0.0

3. **Integration testing**
   - Test all three gems together
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Documentation review

4. **Release**
   - Publish to RubyGems.org
   - Deploy documentation
   - Announce to community

## 🆘 If You Need Help

### Want to Continue?
Once sqa-talib is transferred:
1. Start a new Claude Code session
2. Include all three repos (sqa, sqa-talib, sqa-cli)
3. Reference: ARCHITECTURE.md and TASKS.md
4. I can continue from where we left off
