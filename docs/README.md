"Playing the market" has always felt like "playing roulette" at the casino - "you pays your money and you takes your chances".  Some players are winners.  Some are losers.  But **the House Always Wins.**

Before computers, swings in the market were caused by people.  These days I believe that computers have more to do with it than public trader sentiment.  One computer program can start a cascade of other computer programs selling or buying in a digital frenzy of trading chaos.

There are supposed to be tripwires in the system that protect against such things.

## Recent Computer-caused Chaos

I asked my AI assistant "do you know of any times when computer programs caused trading chaos in the stock market?"

Yes, there have been several instances in history when computer programs have contributed to chaos in the stock market. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **Flash Crash, 2010:** On May 6, 2010, U.S. financial markets experienced a brief, severe, and rapidly-reversed drop in stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by over 1,000 points in a matter of minutes, only to recover just as quickly. This event is known as the "Flash Crash". The crash was primarily blamed on high-frequency trading algorithms - computer programs that execute trades at incredibly high speeds.

2. **Knight Capital Group Incident, 2012:** On August 1, 2012, the company Knight Capital Group experienced a major malfunction in its automated trading software. The software executed trades worth $7 billion in about half an hour, causing Knight Capital's stock price to collapse and leading to a $440 million loss for the company.

3. **Facebook's IPO, 2012:** During the initial public offering of Facebook on May 18, 2012, the stock exchange NASDAQ experienced significant technical problems. The defective technology running NASDAQâ€™s trading software resulted in a delay of the start of trading and confusion over individual share orders, leading to a chaotic and disorderly start to Facebook's life as a public company.

4. **Swiss Franc Surge, 2015:** On January 15, 2015, the Swiss franc surged nearly 30% in a matter of minutes after the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly abolished a cap on the franc's value against the euro. Many automated trading systems were not equipped to handle this abrupt change, resulting in massive losses for many traders and companies.

These events highlight the importance of careful design and rigorous testing for trading algorithms and software systems. They also demonstrate the potential for extreme market volatility in the face of unforeseen software failures or unexpected economic events.

## How to be a Winner

**Knowledge is King** at the casino when playing blackjack, if you can count the cards without getting caught and killed, you can gain a very small advantage over the house.  I was once given the advice to never trade a company that I did not know inside and out or in an industry in which I had no expertise.  Basically the more you know about a company the better your chances of making a beneficial trade.  I guess the extreme of that is being an insider; but there are laws against that right?  Or is it like blackjack and you should just not get caught?

Is it possible to "beat the system?"  Lots of people have become wealthy selling books or services that purport to teach you how.  They all contain the same or similar disclaimers:

> Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses.
>
> Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks. **Under no circumstances shall we be liable** for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through us or our services.

Here's my favorite:

> Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
>
> One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

So it other words "you pays your money and you takes your chances."
