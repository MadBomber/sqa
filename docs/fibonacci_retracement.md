# Fibonacci Retracement

Fibonacci retracement is a popular technical analysis tool used to identify potential levels of support and resistance in a financial market. It is based on the theory that markets tend to move in a series of retracements and expansions, which follow a specific mathematical ratio derived from the Fibonacci sequence.

### How it's Used

Traders and analysts use Fibonacci retracement levels to determine potential areas where the price of an asset may reverse or continue its existing trend. The most commonly used Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.

When a market is trending, a trader would plot the Fibonacci retracement levels on the chart to identify potential areas where the price may pull back and find support (in an uptrend) or resistance (in a downtrend).

If the price retraces to one of these levels and finds support or resistance, it can be seen as an opportunity to enter a trade in the direction of the prevailing trend. Traders often use other technical analysis tools, such as trend lines, moving averages, or candlestick patterns, in combination with Fibonacci retracement to confirm potential trade setups.

### How it's Calculated

The calculation of Fibonacci retracement levels involves using the Fibonacci ratio of 0.236, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, and 0.786.

To plot Fibonacci retracement levels, two points on a chart are required: a swing high and a swing low. A swing high is a peak in an uptrend, while a swing low is a trough in a downtrend.

The retracement levels are calculated by subtracting the percentage ratios (23.6%, 38.2%, etc.) from the difference between the swing high and the swing low. The resulting levels are then plotted on the chart.

For example, to calculate the 38.2% retracement level, the formula would be:

```
Retracement Level = (Swing High - Swing Low) * 0.382 + Swing Low
```

Traders commonly use charting software or online tools that automatically calculate and plot Fibonacci retracement levels. This makes it easier for traders to visualize and analyze potential trading opportunities based on these levels.

Overall, Fibonacci retracement is a valuable technical analysis technique that can assist traders in identifying key support and resistance levels in a trending market. By understanding and correctly utilizing this tool, traders can enhance their decision-making process and potentially improve their trading outcomes.
