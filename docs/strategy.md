# Strategy

A strategy is a recipe that cooks all the indicators together to make a decision on a potential trade.  The SQA::Strategy class provides the framework for executing multiple strategies.

You can also think of a strategy as a set of rules like in the old days of rule-based forward/backward chaining engines.  The rules are evaluated to determine whether a specific decision to trade is good or bad.
