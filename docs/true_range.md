# True Range

Calculates the True Range (TR) for a given set of price data.

The True Range is a measure of the price volatility of a security over a given period. It is calculated as the greatest of the following three values:

* The difference between the current high and the current low.
* The absolute value of the difference between the current high and the previous close.
* The absolute value of the difference between the current low and the previous close.

The True Range helps to capture the true extent of price movement, taking into account potential gaps or price jumps between periods. It is often used as a component in calculating other indicators, such as the Average True Range.
