# Requirements

... otherwise know as what I want to do.  Some people would call it a roadmap; but, where I'm going "we don't need no stinking roads!"

Yes, test driven development (TDD) is important.  There is a place for TDD.  Its not in prototyping.  The prototype is used to figure out what the requirements are.  Once you have a prototype then you have requirements.  With requirements come contracts for APIs.  The contracts drive the test specifications which in turn drives the design.

So what is it that I want to do?

* collect technical analysis indicators to apply to a stock or a set of stocks.
* define an abstraction for a stock
* evaluate different trading strategies.
* make billions on the sock market - if you have kids you know what the sock market is.
* play around with some interesting gems
* evaluate Ruby 3.3 YJIT against Crystal
* look at carious ways to support plugin components
* learn something about options trading in risk mitigation for security trades
