When comparing the fundamentals of different stocks, there are several key indicators to consider in order to make a purchase decision. These indicators can help evaluate the financial health and potential of a company. Some of the key indicators include:

1. **Earnings per Share (EPS):** EPS represents the company's profitability by measuring the portion of earnings allocated to each outstanding share. Higher EPS indicates stronger profitability.

2. **Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E):** P/E ratio compares the stock's current price to its earnings per share. It helps determine if the stock is overvalued or undervalued. Lower P/E ratios suggest better value.

3. **Dividend Yield:** Dividend yield measures the percentage return on investment through dividends. It indicates the amount of cash flow provided to investors as a portion of the stock's price.

4. **Return on Equity (ROE):** ROE measures the profitability of a company by comparing net income to shareholders' equity. Higher ROE indicates a more efficient and profitable company.

5. **Debt to Equity Ratio:** This ratio compares a company's debt to its equity. A lower ratio suggests a healthier financial position with less reliance on borrowed funds.

6. **Growth Rate:** Assessing the historical and projected growth rates of a company's earnings, revenue, and market share can provide insight into its potential for future growth.

7. **Industry and Market Factors:** Analyzing the company's position within its industry, competitive advantages, market trends, and overall economic conditions can provide additional context for investment decisions.

Remember, these indicators should be considered in combination with thorough research and analysis of the company's business model, management team, and competitive landscape. It is essential to evaluate a range of factors to make an informed decision when selecting one stock over another.
