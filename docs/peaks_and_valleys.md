# Peaks and Valleys

In financial technical analysis of stock prices, knowing the peak prices and low prices within a series of prices can provide valuable information. These peak and valley points are often used to identify support and resistance levels, which are important indicators for traders and investors.

- **Peak prices** represent the points at which the price of the stock reaches a high level before declining. This information can help identify potential trends and the maximum price levels that the stock has reached in the past. Traders may use peak prices to set profit targets or to determine when to sell a stock if it reaches a certain price level again.

- **Low prices in valleys** represent the points at which the price of the stock reaches a low level before increasing. These bottom points can help identify potential buying opportunities or areas of support. Traders may use valley prices to set stop-loss orders or to determine when the stock is oversold and potentially undervalued.

By analyzing the peak and valley prices within a series of prices, technical analysts can identify patterns such as trendlines, channels, or chart patterns like head and shoulders. These patterns can provide insights into the future direction of the stock price and help make informed trading decisions.

Overall, understanding the peak prices and low prices within a price array can provide valuable insights into the historical levels of support and resistance, allowing traders to make more informed decisions regarding their buying and selling strategies.
