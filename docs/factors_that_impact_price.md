## Factors that Impact Price

By considering these factors, investors can better understand the potential price movements of stocks and make informed investment decisions.

This breakdown approximates how heavily each factor might typically weigh on stock prices across a varied portfolio. However, in specific scenarios, the impact of each factor could be dramatically different. For instance, in times of global financial crisis, economic indicators and market sentiment might dramatically outweigh company-specific performance, or during a technological breakthrough, industry trends could be the dominant factor.

Ranked most impactful to least impactful.

1. **Company Performance**: 35%
   - The financial health and growth prospects of a company are crucial. Positive earnings reports, strong revenue growth, and effective management often directly translate to increased stock prices.

2. **Market Sentiment**: 25%
   - This is a broad factor that encompasses the psychological aspects of the market. Positive market sentiment can drive prices up rapidly, sometimes irrespective of underlying fundamentals.

3. **Economic Indicators**: 15%
   - Broad economic trends greatly influence investor confidence and expectations. Robust economic growth, for example, tends to buoy most stocks, particularly in sectors closely tied to economic cycles.

4. **Interest Rates**: 10%
   - Changes in interest rates by central banks can shift investor preferences between stocks and bonds, thus having a significant impact on stock prices.

5. **Geopolitical Events**: 10%
   - These events can create considerable market volatility and can impact specific sectors more intensely (e.g., energy stocks during oil crises).

6. **Industry Trends**: 5%
   - While these can be highly impactful on specific stocks or sectors, their broader impact on stock prices across the market tends to be more contained compared to the other factors unless the trend sparks a sector-wide shift.
