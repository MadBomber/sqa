# Donchian Channel

In the domain of computer programming, a Donchian Channel is a technical analysis indicator used to identify potential breakouts and trend reversals in financial markets. It consists of three lines: the upper channel line, the lower channel line, and the middle line.

The upper channel line is calculated by finding the highest high over a specified period of time, while the lower channel line is calculated by finding the lowest low over the same period. The middle line is simply the average of the upper and lower channel lines.
