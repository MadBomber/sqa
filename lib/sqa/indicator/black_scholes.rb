Stock volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. It indicates the risk or uncertainty about
changes in a stock's value.

Examples:
- High volatility: >30% annualized volatility means the stock price is highly unpredictable.
- Low volatility: <10% annualized volatility means the stock price is relatively stable.

To calculate volatility:
1. Compute the daily returns (percentage change in prices).
2. Calculate the standard deviation of these daily returns to get daily volatility.
3. Annualize the daily volatility by multiplying it by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (typically âˆš252).

Your code example calculates the price of European options using the Black-Scholes model, where the `volatility` parameter
represents the stock's volatility, a crucial input for identifying the risk involved in the option's underlying asset.
