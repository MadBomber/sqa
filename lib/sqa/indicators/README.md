# Indicators

An indicator is a formula/metric on a stock's historical activity.  It is presumed to be a forecast as to what the stock activity might be in the future.  A single indicator is not necessarily an accurate predictor of future events not is any specific group of indicators.

In other words the future is uncertain.  Is it a coin flip?  Heads the stock's price goes up.  Tails, the stock's price goes down.  Its one or the other right?  What if the price never changes.  Then its not a coin flip.  Also what is the time frame involved in the forecast?  Is it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, next decade?  What is the delta change in price that can be expected?

So indicators are like TV weather forecastors.  Sometimes they are right.  Sometimes they are wrong.

We are dealing with uncertainity.  In uncertainity there is chaos. If it is possible to be right more times that you are wrong you can make money.  If you are always wrong then always do the opposite and you will make money.  When you are wrong more times than you are right.... you loose.

Its a game.  Game theory tells us that there are winners and losers. Bookies at the track make money every day by taking a cut of the losers loses before giving them to the winners.  Bookies always win so long as they keep their books balanced.  Accounts are important.
