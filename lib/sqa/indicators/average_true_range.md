# Average True Range

Calculates the Average True Range (ATR) for a given set of price data.

The Average True Range is an indicator that calculates the average of the True Range values over a specified period. It provides a measure of the average volatility of a security over that period.

The ATR is commonly used to assess the volatility of a security, identify potential trend reversals, and determine appropriate stop-loss levels. Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility, while lower ATR values indicate lower volatility.

For example, a 14-day Average True Range would calculate the average of the True Range values over the past 14 trading days. Traders and analysts may use this indicator to set stop-loss levels based on the average volatility of the security.
