# SQA - Simple Qualitative Analysis

> A powerful Ruby library for stock market technical analysis and trading strategy development

SQA (Simple Qualitative Analysis) is an educational Ruby library designed for stock market technical analysis and trading strategy development. Built with high-performance data structures and seamlessly integrated with TA-Lib, SQA provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing historical stock data, implementing trading strategies, and backtesting your ideas.

SQA is designed for educational purposes only. It should not be used for actual trading without extensive testing and professional financial advice. Trading stocks involves substantial risk of loss.

    - [Ema Strategy](https://madbomber.github.io/sqa/strategies/ema): Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to price changes.
    - [Stochastic Strategy](https://madbomber.github.io/sqa/strategies/stochastic): Compares closing price to the price range over a period to identify overbought/oversold conditions and momentum changes.
    - [Volume Breakout](https://madbomber.github.io/sqa/strategies/volume-breakout): Identifies price breakouts confirmed by high trading volume for stronger signal reliability.
    - [Mean Reversion](https://madbomber.github.io/sqa/strategies/mean-reversion): Based on the theory that prices tend to return to their average over time. Buys when price is below average and sells when above.
    - [Market Profile](https://madbomber.github.io/sqa/strategies/market-profile): Uses market profile analysis to identify support and resistance levels, generating signals when price reaches these key levels.
